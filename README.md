# Simulation of Stochastic Processes in Python

This project implements numerical simulations of classical stochastic processes using Python and NumPy.

## Brownian Bridge

The Brownian bridge is constructed in two different ways:

- Using the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix
- Using the transformation U_t = B_t - tB_1

Both constructions are compared numerically.

## Implemented Processes

- Brownian motion
- Brownian bridge
- Compensated squared Brownian motion
- Exponential martingale
- Poisson process
- Compensated Poisson process

## Mathematical Concepts

- Independent increments
- Martingale property
- Compensation technique
- Stochastic integration (conceptual link)

## Tools

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Purpose

The objective of this project is to connect theoretical stochastic analysis with numerical simulations and visualize key martingale properties.
